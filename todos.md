1. onboarding doesn't fully work
2. when adding a transaction save button is hidden by keeboard. it should be the most convenient action to add an expanse (and very small clicks 2-3), drag and drop, enter amount (opt. enter a comment), save. everything close to the thumb
3. add CFO like charts with description and translsation on report page, also if some base lines or target values are needed from user, add them to settings page
4. there's a plan on how to create an audio expense record
